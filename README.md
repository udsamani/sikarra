# Sikarra


A sophisticated Rust based arbitrage and marjet making system that monitors decentralized exhange (DEX) pools and centralized exchange (CEX) price feeds to identify tradin opportunities on **Base** Network.

## üöÄ Overview

The system is based on an even driven architecture.

## Core Components
- `sikkara-adapters`: Exchange adapters for CEX (Coinbase WebSocket) and DEX (Uniswap V4) integration
- `sikkara-arbitrager`: Main arbitrage detection and market making logic
- `sikkara-core`: Shared utilities, engine framework, and common types
- `sikkara-wsclient`: WebSocket client infrastructure with reconnection and heartbeat

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Price Monitoring
- **Real-time CEX Data**: WebSocket connection to Coinbase Pro for live ETH/USDC pricing
- **On-chain DEX Data**: Direct integration with Uniswap V4 pool contracts on Base
- **High-precision Calculations**: Uses 512-bit decimal arithmetic for financial accuracy

### Arbitrage Detection
- **Cross-venue Price Comparison**: Identifies price discrepancies between CEX and DEX
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set minimum profit percentages and absolute amounts
- **Directional Analysis**: Determines optimal buy/sell venue combinations
